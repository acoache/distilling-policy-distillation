# Distilling Policy Distillation

Slides on the paper ["Distilling Policy Distillation" from Czarnecki et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02186) and code notebook to exemplify a key idea in that paper. This project was done during the course "Minimizing Expectations" at the University of Toronto with [Chris Maddison](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~cmaddis/).

The code notebook is also available as a [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CmSo-hMKb74zVPxCFJ8TIl6Iacxc2l3b?usp=sharing).
